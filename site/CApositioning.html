	Types of Positioning
	block: This makes the element a block box. It won't let anything sit next to it on the page! It takes up the full width.

inline-block: This makes the element a block box, but will allow other elements to sit next to it on the same line.

inline: This makes the element sit on the same line as another element, but without formatting it like a block. It only takes up as much width as it needs (not the whole line).

none: This makes the element and its content disappear from the page entirely!
