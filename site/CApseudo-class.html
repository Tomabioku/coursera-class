		Pseudo-class selectors let us style these kinds of changes in our HTML document. For example, we saw we could change a link's text-decoration property to make it something other than blue and underlined. Using pseudo selectors, you can control the appearance of unvisited and visited linksâ€”even links the user is hovering over but hasn't clicked!

		Another useful pseudo-class selector is first-child. It's used to apply styling to only the elements that are the first children of their parents.

		a:link: An unvisited link.
		a:visited: A visited link.
		a:hover: A link you're hovering your mouse 
		p:first-child : first children of their parents.
