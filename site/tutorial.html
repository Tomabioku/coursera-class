	The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other.
	margin-top: /*some value*/
	margin-right: /*some value*/
	margin-bottom: /*some value*/
	margin-left: /*some-value*/

The border is the edge of the element. It's what we've been making visible every time we set the border property.

The padding is the spacing between the content and the border. We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content. padding is the space between your border and your innermost layer: the actual content.
padding-top: /*some value*/
padding-right: /*some value*/
padding-bottom: /*some value*/
padding-left: /*some-value*/

The content is the actual "stuff" in the box. If we're talking about a <p> element, the "stuff" is the text of the paragraph.
